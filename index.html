            <p>Hello! My name is Nicole Thomas and I am from Huntsville, Alabama. I enjoy playing video games, cooking, watching TV and hanging with my family. I grew up in California but have moved across the country a number of times.
                I have lived in New Hampshire, Utah and now Alabama. I have 4 bonus kids and a set of twins. All the older kids have moved out and now it is just the crazy twins in the house. We spend most of our days working and going to school.
                 and our nights are filled with board games, and video games with each other. I am also a huge jeep finatic. Being able to customize your vehicle to exactly who you are is a really awesome feeling. 
                I went back to school to get my degree when the twins went to school full time. This is my last semester and hope to be done in July. Once I am done with my degree I hope to joing the work force again.
            </p>
